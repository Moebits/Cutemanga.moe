# CuteManga.moe

CuteManga is a website where you can read manga with selectable text (OCR). It is a fun way to study japanese. The manga is 
generated with [MangaOCR](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr), and specifically we use [Mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro) 
and [Mokuro2Pdf](https://github.com/Kartoffel0/Mokuro2Pdf) scripts to OCR the manga and convert them to PDF files. 

We have a custom PDF viewer which is explained in more detail below.

### Switching to English

You can quickly switch to an English-translated version of the manga to check that you are understanding it correctly. Since Google Translate
is very poor at translating vertical text, it often yields very unnatural/nonsensical dialogue, so it is better to refer a humanly-translated version 
instead.

### Reading Direction

You can change the reading direction between top to bottom (most common), or right to left, which is how manga are traditionally read.
